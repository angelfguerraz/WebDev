JAVASCRIPT

* Dinamic: Runs in RUNTIME phase, without needing to be compiled.
* Interpreted: Just intime compiler. Browser reads 1:1 the code and executes it.
* Backward compatible: New versions of the language won't damage the started programs.
			Nonetheless, in order to apply them one should use js compilers, e.g; Babel. 

* Hoisting: Calling/Using a variable that hasn't been declared or initialized yet.
		The compiler declares all functions and variables at the top of the programm, if nothing given than __undifined__

* Coertion: Changing variable-types, either implicit (e.g: 1+"2", 2*"3"), or ecplicit applying function methods
